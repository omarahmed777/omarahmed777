### Hey! ðŸŽˆ
I'm Omar, currently a 2nd year at University of Birmingham studying Computer Science w/ Year in Industry BSc 

I'm not currently working on anything as being a full-time student makes up most of my time, but I am interested in working on a discord bot soon. Feel free to reach out with any ideas, but please bear with me if I take some time to reply.

You can mainly reach me on discord @ Nerdy#9545, but please send a message first so I know you're not a bot ðŸ˜„

- Languages: Python, Java & Javascript, CSS & HTML, VisualBasic, C, and Haskell
